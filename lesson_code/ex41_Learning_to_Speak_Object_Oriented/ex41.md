# Learn to Speak Object-Oriented

## Word Drills

- **class** Tell Python to make a new type of thing.
- **object** Two meanings: the most basic type of thing, and any instance of some thing.
- **instance** What you get when you tell Python to create a class.
- **def** How you define a function inside a class.
- **self** Inside the functions in a class, self is a variable for the instance/object being accessed.
- **inheritance** The concept that one class can inherit traits from another class, much like you and your parents.
- **composition** The concept that a class can be composed of other classes as parts, much like how a car has wheels.
- **attribute** A property classes have that are from composition and are usually variables.
- **is-a** A phrase to say that something inherits from another, as in a "salmon" _is-a_ "fish."
- **has-a** A phrase to say that something is composed of other things or has a trait, as in "a salmon _has-a_ mouth."

## Phrase Drills

```python
class X(Y):

# Make a class named X that is-a Y.
# Make a class named CAT that is-a ANIMAL.
```

```python
class X(object):
  def __init__(self, J):

# Class X has-a __init__ that takes self and J parameters.
# Class CAR has-a __init__ that takes self and J as a parameter.
```

```python
class X(object):
  def M(self, J):

# class X has-a function named M that takes self and J parameters.
```

```python
foo = X()

# Set foo to an instance of class X.
```

```python
foo.M(J)

# From foo, get the M function, and call it with parameters self, J.
```

```python
foo.K = Q

# From foo, get the K attribute, and set it to Q.
```
